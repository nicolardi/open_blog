Hello! this is the repo I use to publish contents on my own blog about open source!

In my [blog](https://www.massimonicolardi.it) I publish what I have learned by reading the source code of open source repositories on [github.com](https://github.com)

It is also a "trial & error" experiment to learn how to approach the problem of "understanding what a large and mostly unknown codebase do"
