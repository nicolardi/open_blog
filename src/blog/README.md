# Introduction

Read the code! the real documentation is the code itself!

[TL;DR]

I am a passionate computer programmer since I was twelve. 
During my life, I spent a lot of effort learning new languages, programming patterns, system architecture, and even video game development. 

This blog is just a sort of "diary" of my journey in the the land of code.

I have always had many difficulties trying to read a large codebase written by someone. I have tied very hard to develop the skill of reading reading other programmers' code. I have watched many youtube videos and web articles but I have noticed that all these stuff is pretty general and do not cover real-life examples of reading the actual code.

Then I changed my job. 

And one of my new mates is a very experienced senior programmer.
I consider him a genial programmer but he's not the kind of person who likes to explain things in detail.

He says about himself "I don't consider myself a good programmer. I have just one attitude. I read the code. So read the code!"

The first blood
::: 

Following his advice I decided to try to read some code. I opened [github.com](https://www.github.com)  
And I choose a random repository: [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

Anywhere I clicked there were tons of files. I felt overwhelmed and it seemed I could never succeed. 
I went to sleep quite depressed and feeling very inadequate.

The rule of 90%
:::

The next day I was wake up and tried to to elaborate a little bit more. It came to my mind a rule I learned many years ago when I was studying english.

::: tip
You cannot learn anything from movies you understand less of 90% 
:::

In other words, you cannot benefit from learning from a resource you don't know well.

Second blood: let's try again!
:::
In the afternoon I decided to give it a try.  
I opened the webpack source code again but instead of trying to understand it I tried to identify little interesting things driven just by my own curiosity.

Instead of trying to understand at 1000 files, I was focusing on just one of them. 

My attention fell on the things I didn't know...  whatever I could not explain well it was something to get into it.

::: tip
Often the real interesting things are not things you are looking at but what's around them 
:::

This was the start of my journey in the ocean of open source code. 
Finally I started figuring out how things REALLY work in the world of software. 

Reading the code is an incredible source of inspiration. That's why I have had the idea to share this experience with all of you.
